# nosnap
Let's be brutally honest, nobody needs snap, that being said...

Run following command from terminal:

    curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pabonx21/nosnap/refs/heads/main/nosnap.sh | sudo bash

> Script will automatically install Flatpak as an alternative to Snap. You are welcome. :)
